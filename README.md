The rampant growth of deepfakes necessitates effective detection methods are essential to uphold the integrity of multimedia. This paper proposes a novel, hybrid architecture that synergistically fuses Residual Networks and Long Short-Term Memory with Convolutional Neural Networks for enhanced deepfake detection.
Our framework leverages ResNet's adeptness in extracting intricate spatial features from facial and contextual information. At the same time, the LSTM-CNN module captures subtle temporal changes in facial expressions and movements across sequential frames.
This synergy empowers the model to achieve superior accuracy, precision, and recall compared to existing methods, demonstrably outperforming competitors on diverse datasets like Face Forensics++ and DFDC. 
We further bolster model generalizability and combat evolving deepfake techniques through transfer learning, pre-training on ImageNet, and fine-tuning on deepfake-specific data. Notably, our model exhibits noteworthy robustness against adversarial attacks, showcasing its potential for real-world deployment. 
This novel framework paves the way for advancements in multimedia forensics and offers a promising solution to mitigate the growing threat of deep fakes in 
the digital landscape.
